I'm a motivated junior front-end developer from Wroc≈Çaw, Poland. I have a subsidiary protection.

I am constantly concentrated on deepen my skills in coding, Javascript and React. I want to become that missing part of a friendly team, unleash my potential and grow together with the company.

    const vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'];
